Value Type
A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space.

When you pass a value-type variable from one method to another, the system creates a separate copy of a variable in another method. 
If value got changed in the one method, it wouldn't affect the variable in another method.

Reference Type
A reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

When you pass a reference type variable from one method to another, it doesn't create a new copy; instead, it passes the variable's address. 
So, If we change the value of a variable in a method, it will also be reflected in the calling method.

String is a reference type, but it is immutable. 
It means once we assigned a value, it cannot be changed
