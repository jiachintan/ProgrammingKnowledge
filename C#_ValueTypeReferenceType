Value Type
A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space.

When you pass a value-type variable from one method to another, the system creates a separate copy of a variable in another method. 
If value got changed in the one method, it wouldn't affect the variable in another method.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference Type
A reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

When you pass a reference type variable from one method to another, it doesn't create a new copy; instead, it passes the variable's address. 
So, If we change the value of a variable in a method, it will also be reflected in the calling method.

String is a reference type, but it is immutable. 
It means once we assigned a value, it cannot be changed
Example 1:
static void ChangeReferenceType(Student std2)
{
    std2.StudentName = "Steve";
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Student std1 = new Student();
    std1.StudentName = "Bill";
    
    ChangeReferenceType(std1);

    Console.WriteLine(std1.StudentName); // output is "Steve"
}

Exmaple 2:
static void ChangeReferenceType(string name)
{
    name = "Steve";
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    string name = "Bill";
    
    ChangeReferenceType(name);

    Console.WriteLine(name); // output is "Bill"
}
