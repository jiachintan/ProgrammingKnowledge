struct is the value type data type that represents data structures. 
It can contain a parameterized constructor, static constructor, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events, and nested types.

Summary
struct can include constructors, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events & nested types.
struct cannot include a parameterless constructor or a destructor.
struct can implement interfaces, same as class.
struct cannot inherit another structure or class, and it cannot be the base of a class.
struct members cannot be specified as abstract, sealed, virtual, or protected.

struct Coordinate
{
    private int _x, _y;

    public int x 
    {
        get{
            return _x;
        }

        set{
            _x = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_x);
        }
    }

    public int y
    {
        get{
            return _y;
        }

        set{
            _y = value;
            CoordinatesChanged(_y);
        }
    }

    public event Action<int> CoordinatesChanged;
}


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Coordinate point = new Coordinate();
        
        point.CoordinatesChanged += StructEventHandler;
        point.x = 10;
        point.y = 20;
    }

    static void StructEventHandler(int point)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Coordinate changed to {0}", point);
    }
}
