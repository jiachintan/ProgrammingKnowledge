The StringBuilder doesn't create a new object in the memory but dynamically expands memory to accommodate the modified string.


Points to Remember :
StringBuilder is mutable.
StringBuilder performs faster than string when appending multiple string values.
Use StringBuilder when you need to append more than three or four strings.
Use the Append() method to add or append strings to the StringBuilder object.
Use the ToString() method to retrieve a string from the StringBuilder object.
