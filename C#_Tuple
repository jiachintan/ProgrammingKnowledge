A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types. 
It can be used where you want to have a data structure to hold an object with properties, but you don't want to create a separate type for it.

Tuple<int, string, string> person = 
            new Tuple <int, string, string>(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
            
var person = Tuple.Create(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
person.Item1; // returns 1
person.Item2; // returns "Steve"
person.Item3; // returns "Jobs"


Usage of Tuple
Tuples can be used in the following scenarios:
When you want to return multiple values from a method without using ref or out parameters.
When you want to pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter.
When you want to hold a database record or some values temporarily without creating a separate class.


Tuple Limitations:
The Tuple is a reference type and not a value type. It allocates on heap and could result in CPU intensive operations.
The Tuple is limited to include eight elements. You need to use nested tuples if you need to store more elements. However, this may result in ambiguity.
The Tuple elements can be accessed using properties with a name pattern Item<elementNumber>, which does not make sense.
